Tuples are technically defined by the presence of a comma; the parentheses make them
look neater and more readable. If you want to define a tuple with one element, you
need to include a trailing comma:

For dictionaries, specifically, you can use the get() method to
set a default value that will be returned if the requested key doesnâ€™t exist.

items(): Use when needed to loop through key-value pair.
keys(): Use when only need to access the keys.
set(): A set is a collection in which each item must be unique.
input() : For user interaction STRING only.
int() : string to integer

docstring: are enclosed in triple quotes, which python looks for whne it generates 
documentation for the functions in your programs  .

single * in a function parameter creates a tuple. example, *args creates
a tuple called args.

Double * in a function parameter creates a dictionary. example, **args
creates a dictionary called args.
